// A MIDI input port of our own, because MPC OS doesn't send MIDI to insert effects.
//
// Each instance opens an ALSA sequencer client ("RMXXXL 1", "RMXXXL 2", ...) with one writable port.
// MPC detects it without a restart and offers it as a MIDI output, so a MIDI track can play the
// effect. libasound is loaded at runtime (it is already in the MPC process), so the build needs no
// ALSA headers; where it's missing (the Mac test build) the port simply isn't there.
